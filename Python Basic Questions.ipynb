What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","  - Python is a programming language used to communicate with computers, software applications, embedded softwares. Python is popular due to following reasons\n","  \n","  - Easy to read and code\n","  - Has extensive set of libraries\n","  - It is widely used across industries\n","  - Allows developer to focus more on logic rather than remebering the syntax\n","\n","\n","  2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","    - It is a program that reads and executes codes direcly without converting it in to machine language. Examples of Python interpreters are CPython, PyPy, IronPython etc.\n","\n","  3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","     - Predifined keywords hold a special meaning and purpose e.g. break, continue, false, true etc. They are used to write programming logic.\n","\n","  4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","   - No we cannot use keywords as variable names. Python interpreter will throw exception if they are used to name variables.\n","\n","  5. What is mutability in Python?\n","     - It is the ability of an object to be modified after creation. Examples for mutable objects are Lists, Dictionaries, Set.\n","\n","  6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","     - Lists are mutable because elements can be added, removed and changed after the list is created. It is useful when there is a need to modify exising data frequently as the object share the same memory.\n","     - Tuples are immutable because elements of a tuple cannot be modified after the tuple is created. It ensures safety and performance.\n","\n","  7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","    - “==” operator is used to compare values of two objects. e.g x==y\n","    - \"is\" operator is used to check identity of objects. It checks whether values at both the sides of the operator point to same object. e.g. a is b\n","\n","  8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","    - Logical opearators are used to compare values of two operands and determine if the result is true or false. Examples of logical operators are ==,!=, >,< etc.\n","\n","  9. What is type casting in Python?\n","    - Type casting refers to conversion a data type to another data type.\n","      \n","      For example:\n","      quantity=5\n","\n","      amountperunit=6.5\n","\n","      totalcost=quantity*amountperunit\n","\n","      print(c)\n","\n","      Output: 30.5\n","\n","      Here after multiplying quantity(int) and amountperunit(float) variable values python converts 'totalcost' variable to float data type\n","      \n","\n","  10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","      - Implicit Type Casting - A data type gets converted to another data type automatically.\n","      - Explicit Type Casting - In this, the user must clearly spcify the data type for conversion. Python converts a smaller data type to bigger data type without any data loss.\n","\n","  11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","        - Statements used to excecute a block of code based on a specific condition that evaluates to true or false are known as conditional statements.\n","\n","  12. How does the elif statement work?\n","      -  Elif statement is used to handle multiple if conditions and execute the corresponding block of code. For example: In case,  condition specified in If statement evaluates to false then program logic moves to Elif statement.\n","\n","      For example:\n","      \n","      marks = int(input(\"Enter your marks: \"))\n","\n","      if marks > 80 and marks <= 100:\n","      \n","        print(\"A Grade\")\n","\n","     elif marks > 60 and marks <=80:\n","\n","        print (\"B Grade\")\n","          \n","\n","  13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","    - In while loop, loop control condition is checked at the begining of the loop and code inside the loop is executed as long as the condition specified evaluates to true.\n","     \n","       For example:\n","\n","       age = 20\n","     \n","       while age < 18:\n","     \n","            print(\"Age should be greater than 18 years\")\n","\n","       else:\n","\n","            print(\"You are eligible for the tournament\")\n","\n","    - For loop is used when we know the number of times a block of code should be exceuted. It iterates over a sequence like list, tuple, set etc.\n","  \n","  14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","\n","    -  On the payment page of website, customer must enter an amount > $1 before processing the payment.\n","    - Another scenario is to ensure attachment size before submitting Aadhar application form\n","    "],"metadata":{"id":"1uKvatcGuIZR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"UkZXqtLgRat5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
